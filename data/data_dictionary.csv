Water supply,Imported/purchased water suppplied ,Water supply water imported,"Purchased or imported water - Suppliers may import or purchase water from other Suppliers or other
entities. Suppliers will make their own determination as to whether a
supply is purchased, imported, transferred, or exchanged. Suppliers may possess Contract Water Supplies, including Water
Supply Entitlements or Water Supply Agreements, that are derived
from local, regional, state, and federal water agencies. These contracts
may include wholesale delivery contracts, contracts based upon state
and federal water projects, and localized contracts between regional
entities for surface or groundwater. Suppliers will make their own
determination as to whether they use water contracts to divert and
deliver water supplies to their customers.",,,"Water imported - Bulk water purchased to become part of the Water Supplied volume. Typically this is water purchased from a neighboring water utility or regional water authority, and is metered at the custody transfer point of interconnection between the two water utilities. Usually the meter(s) are owned by the water supplier selling the water to the utility conducting the water audit. The water supplier selling the bulk water usually charges the receiving utility based upon a wholesale water rate.",,

another water user, with the receiving water user providing water in
return at a specified time or when the conditions of the parties‚Äô

on a basis agreed upon by the participants or it can include payment
and the return of water. The water returned may or may not be an

Water supply,Recycled water supplied,Wastewater and recycled water,"Recycled water - Municipal recycled water is municipal wastewater that has been
treated to a specified quality to enable it to be used again for a
beneficial purpose. The term recycled water is defined in the Water
Code more broadly than municipal recycled water. For purposes of the
UWMPs, recycled water means only municipal recycled water, that is,
water that has been treated and discharged from a municipal
wastewater facility.
There are two requirements treated municipal wastewater must meet
to be classified as recycled water:
1. It must be reused beneficially, in a manner consistent with Title
22;
2. It must be reused in accordance with a Regional Water Quality
Control Board permit such as National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System, waste discharge requirement, or water
recycling requirement.","Recycled water - Recycled municipal wastewater is recycled water used for indirect potable reuse,  such as the effluent from the treatment of wastewater of municipal origin.",,,,

Water supply,Volume from own sources,Water supply own sources,,,,"Own sources - The volume of water withdrawn (abstracted) from water resources (rivers, lakes, streams, wells, etc) controlled by the water utility, and then treated for potable water distribution. Most water audits are compiled for utility retail water distribution systems, so this volume should reflect the amount of treated drinking water that entered the distribution system. Often the volume of water measured at the effluent of the treatment works is slightly less than the volume measured at the raw water source, since some of the water is used in the treatment process. Thus, it is useful if flows are metered at the effluent of the treatment works. If metering exists only at the raw water source, an adjustment for water used in the treatment process should be included to account for water consumed in treatment operations such as filter backwashing, basin flushing and cleaning, etc. If the audit is conducted for a wholesale water agency that sells untreated water, then this quantity reflects the measure of the raw water, typically metered at the source.",,

for processing agricultural products (e.g., food, beverage, or textile
manufacturing) may be considered industrial process water, rather
