Time and resource constraints,"Small staff wearing many hats makes delivering timely, high-quality data infeasible","""...Rarely if you're at an agency that is like, has more than, I don't know 50 employees, maybe if you're lucky you have two people that do it, but usually the person that's doing your water resources is also doing your communications, your outreach, managing a program…So what happens is you are doing all of these things. The benefit is 'cause you can kind of see how they all could be improved, but you're not doing anything super well. You're just kind of getting it done, getting it out the door.”",
Time and resource constraints,Coodindating across departments and consistent reporting agency-wide is challenging and time consuming,,"“…So I feel like just the processing and coordination also takes a lot of time. It's a lot of time, just spending on that actually.”"
Time and resource constraints,The time and resources to set up automated workflows are not available to smaller agencies,"“…And but again, it's a timing issue of sometimes we just don't have time to go through, like to pull all that data, you know, there's just no time to do that. I mean, does time exist? Yes, absolutely. If I could hire a consultant and that's all they did. Absolutely, they could. That would be awesome, but to get my Board to approve, you know $150 to $200,000 annual contract to have someone do that is the chances of that are very small.”","“I think the other challenge that we have so many resources to dedicate to tracking and data QA/QC, it's not reasonable to expect utilities across the board to be able to do that."""
Data quality,Data are not available in the timeline requested so we report an estimate or proxy,"“But what was surprising to me when I first came over to the district is what they are reporting to the state is not what is being asked for, and it's pretty common knowledge amongst water agencies that that's not what you're doing. We don't report water use at all. Honestly, we report production and we are hoping to change that, but we honestly just don't have the staff or the capabilities to do it accurately.”","“At the customer level it's every two months, it’s bimonthly for most customers, and so you don't have real time data for that, and so there's a little bit of an issue when, like we do a Monthly Report and they want to know residential use. We use, you know, an equation to guess based on a ratio from, you know, last year or something to determine that, but we just don't have real time data… Well, so the way it is we have a per total production number and then we look at what the billed residential was for a previous time period and we use that ratio to apply it for the current because we don't have current.”"
Data quality,QA/QC processes,"[Does your agency have a quality control or quality assurance process for water use data?] “Yes, of course we do, uhm. We, I mean, by process I would say more than one set of eyes looks at it. Is it written down anywhere? I don't think so. So it's kind of like a visual check of data.”","“All the data are accurate, so um our target, I mean we have our criteria. We're trying to make all the accuracy close to 2% and less than 5%. So, um, there's some ongoing maintenance and also kind of routine data checking and a verification going on. So that's just for our billing from the treated water side.”"
Data quality,Data management systems and tools,"“I have a spreadsheet that goes back to the 80s I think, but I couldn't tell you where it came from. I got it from our finance person. So when I started, our finance guy was like here you go. Uhm, has it ever been checked? Has it been verified where the formulas came from? Couldn't tell you.”","“…We're building a water loss dashboard which would essentially allow us to do mass balances of the amount of water that came in versus the amount of water that went out on like a daily resolution…And we the goal is to do that by pressure zone. And so a lot of what we do now, which is manual like manually tracking from month to month like what our water loss is, with this data we’ll hopefully be able to do like in an automated fashion at whatever resolution we decide to tell our tool to do it. So we're progressing and trying to get to more of that automated approach.”"
Ethics and community,Desire to support better water resource policy and acess to high quality data,"“Yep, re-save it on an annual basis. Do I want to fix it? Absolutely; I absolutely do.”","“We've reached out to DWR and the State Board, and we've offered to help come up with a single definition that could be used across those two departments and across utilities. And even maybe even work with the Consortium to help put on webinars and stuff and work with utilities so that we start defining things more consistently so we can make better policy.”"
Definitions,Inconsistencies across state reporting requirements,,"“…The EAR categories and the Urban Water Management categories and the categories from the Monthly Report don't all, they're not the same. So even if we did have a way to match, they'd be inconsistent because the reports are inconsistent.”"
Definitions,Inconsistencies across agencies,,"“…And then you have the discrepancy between how water utilities define residential and commercial and a lot of it can be determined by the limitations of your billing system. You know, it's determined by whether you're a city or a water utility.” 

“But in talking to the State Board, they're like, well, why don't you just define it for yourself? And I'm like, well, I think we had to be consistent and like I'm happy to define it for myself, yeah, but then it won't map to any other utility so that when they roll it up it won't mean anything.” 

“But like again, it goes back to definitional inconsistency where even though it reads a certain way, some will interpret it a different way. So yeah, I think they need to be very clear with an example.”"
Definitions,Inconsistencies with state definition and local agency definitions,,"""And then, internally, because we're not a land use agency, we're not using like R1 as a zone to just to define what our residents are. We kind of have our own rate codes that we're using internally."" 

“…The buckets they often have and the way that they want you to describe shortages don't always match how we think about water, and so it's really like they say, please provide us the amount of imported, you're providing the amount of surface water supplies, you're providing the amount of recycled water supplies, but because we're conjunctively managed our imported water is pretty much a lot of it's going into the ground and then some, a lot of it is going to treatment plants and so if we just say the direct delivery via treatment plants that really underrepresents the amount of imported water reuse in our county.”"
Utility of state reporting requirements,Internal use for the reports,"“Even if it's not 100% accurate, we use [our Urban Water Management Plan] to dictate where our capital improvements are going to come, and we do use it to see those projections.” 

“The water, like the same data we use for the State, um, I report out that information to my board on a monthly basis.”","“The Urban Water Management Plan does have some limitations in terms of what we really want to be able to look at for planning for the future. And kind of looking at, you know, different bounds of like what could happen, whereas you know the Urban Water Management Plan, just kind of takes a snap picture in time and says OK if this is what it was again, how would it be? Instead of thinking outside of that box so. But I think I think it's it still has useful information and useful data that all feeds into other reports so. Yeah, and the I mean the Monthly Report, we collected all that data before we started doing the report.” 

“I think the raw data itself has a lot of value. A lot of the contextual items are just hard 'cause it's kind of like they're trying to look at across the state and figure out what context is helpful, and it doesn't necessarily capture all of the issues. And there's not really good guidance to say like how you fit into their definitions and contexts that they're trying to ask for and, and so that's where it gets complicated.” 

“They did mention that we don't use these [Monthly Reports] internally, we just collect the data and send it out. But anyone who is paying attention this data is already aware of what these numbers are. I think they're looking at a more regular interval than monthly anyways.” 

“[We use the Monthly Report] to look at our trends, you know, for are we, like, what's our conservation, you know, level and things like that… but we wouldn't necessarily do it the way we're asked to do for the State Board.”"
Utility of state reporting requirements,Lack of clarity about how the state uses the data,,"“I don't think that there's a good discussion of the use case of like defining the use case and making sure there's alignment on that before asking for a new data set. And that's kind of fundamentally the problem with a lot of these is we have our own internal use cases that don't align because we're not looking across agencies, we're looking at our own agency.” 

“They keep adding information and sections. It seems like they want to know more and more information every year and I'm always curious what they, what are they using these information for?”"
Recommendations,One repository for raw data elements to be submitted annually,"“But it's difficult to get those improvements under the political infrastructure that exists, which is not ideal when you're dealing with data. But it is the reality of what we're dealing with, and so I think that if for all of us, if we could streamline everything and like I was saying, if there could be one place where I could see the formula…And it's not that expensive. Like we just did a quote for one and he was like I could bring you up to speed with a $15,000 and a $20,000 maintenance fee annually. That's not expensive, but for a small district like mine, a conservative board, they're not going to approve it.”","“The general stuff we report is kind of the same. It's just that this report slices these general things one way or the other one slices a little bit the other way…So if there were some kind of like or we can just push all this to one place and you can see, oh, there's the table of this, there's the table of that. Then people could ask whatever questions they want from that data versus asking us the questions then we go crunch the numbers into this thing and then crunch numbers into that thing.” 

“If we only had to report all of our data to one thing, place, whatever, repository. You know, put it all in one place on an annual basis. Every data point that's needed for everything, and then even if other third parties had permission to access it, they could go and get it from that place. That would make our lives so much easier.” 

""...whereas if they were just are asking for a general, more bulk sense of our data then they could change their formats however they wanted and handle that translation themselves. So that would be one major upgrade right there.”"
Recommendations,Education and outreach,“…[The California Water Data Consortium] could really teach and train people on how to think about data and how to put a spreadsheet together.,"“We've reached out to DWR and the State Board, and we've offered to help come up with a single definition that could be used across those two departments and across utilities. And even maybe even work with the Consortium to help put on webinars and stuff and work with utilities so that we start defining things more consistently so we can make better policy.”"
Recommendations,Minor technological changes,,"“And the one I got from [omitted] was saving prior months of data in that reporting so that you can just correct, you can make changes, not really repeat yourself. And he also mentioned they should, you know, make sure that they're using the data they're asking for, or else don't ask for data that they're not going to use because that's kind of wasted effort.”"
